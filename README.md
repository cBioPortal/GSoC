# cBioPortal's Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

Welcome to cBioPortal's Google Summer of Code (GSoC) üëã! GSoC is a great program to get some experience with open source development. Our organization aims to help clinicians and research more easily analyze complex cancer genomics data. Working with cBioPortal is not only fun but also extremely rewarding in that your work directly affects cancer research.

## About Google Summer of Code

[Google Summer of Code<sup>TM</sup>](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a summer program that offers stipends to develop software for open source projects.

## Project ideas

A list of cBioPortal GSoC project ideas are [available on GitHub with label GSoC-2024](https://github.com/cBioPortal/GSoC/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AGSoC-2024). If you have any questions about any of the ideas, please comment in the issues on GitHub or ask us on the [cBioPortal Public Slack](https://slack.cbioportal.org).

## How to apply

- Get familiar with the [cBioPortal](https://cbioportal.org). [Our tutorials](https://www.cbioportal.org/tutorials) might be useful. cBioPortal combines a lot of different disciplines so please take your time to fully understand the purpose and plan of the idea. Please feel free to ask us questions if anything is unclear. We are here to help!
- Get familiar with cBioPortal's [backend](https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal) and [frontend](https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal-frontend) codebase. If you want to get your feet wet, there are also [good first issues](https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
- Develop your project proposal based on one of [the ideas](https://github.com/cBioPortal/GSoC/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AGSoC-2024). Please feel free to come up with your own project idea. We recommend looking at [how to write a proposal](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal).
- Start with the [proposal template](https://github.com/cBioPortal/GSoC/wiki/template).
- What we are looking for in the proposal are: 1) your understanding of the proposed project; 2) your understanding of cbioportal and its code base; 3) a concrete plan of implementation.
- Submit your proposal early. We will start to provide feedbacks to proposals once they are submitted.
- If you have any questions about any of the ideas, please comment on GitHub issues or ask us on the [cBioPortal Public Slack](https://slack.cbioportal.org). You can also send us your draft proposal privately on Slack.
- For questions of eligibility, see [GSoC FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#what_are_the_eligibility_requirements_for_participation). Note that unlike previous years, it is not necessary to be enrolled in an academic program, allowing anyone eager to learn to participate.

## About the cBioPortal

The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics is a resource designed to provide broad community access to cancer genomic data. It provides a unique user¬≠-friendly and "biology¬≠-centric computational user interface", with the goal of making genomic data more easily accessible to translational scientists, biologists, and clinicians. The interface was explicitly built and continues to evolve with careful usability studies involving multiple biological and clinical users, and an active and engaged user base.

The [public instance of cBioPortal](http://www.cbioportal.org/) is now one of the most popular online resources for cancer genomics data and attracts more than 3,000 unique visitors (cancer researchers and clinicians) per day. The two papers documenting the cBioPortal ([Cerami et al. Cancer Discov. 2012](http://cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org/content/2/5/401.abstract) & [Gao et al. Sci. Signal. 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23550210)) have been cited more than 10,000 and 9,000 times, respectively, since their publication.

The cBioPortal project has become an [open source project](https://github.com/cBioPortal/) under the Affero General Public License (AGPL), due to the high demand for local installations and contribution requests. There are more than 60 actively used cBioPortal instances in hospitals, universities, pharmaceutical companies, and other institutes all over the globe. Notable, cBioPortal has been adopted as the analysis and visualization platform by [AACR GENIE](http://blog.aacr.org/aacr-project-genie-the-sharing-economy-comes-to-the-clinic/) (an international multi-institutional data-sharing project to catalyze precision oncology).

## About us

We are a group of software engineers, bioinformaticians, and cancer biologists building software solutions for precision medicine for cancer patients. Our overall goal is to build infrastructure to support clinical decisions for personalized cancer treatment by utilizing ‚Äúbig data‚Äù of cancer genomics and patient clinical profiles. Our multi-institutional team currently has more than 30 active members, primarily from [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/) in New York, [the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](http://www.dana-farber.org/) in Boston, [Princess Margaret Cancer Centre](http://www.theprincessmargaret.ca/) in Toronto, [Children's Hospital of Philadelphia](http://www.chop.edu/), and [The Hyve, a bioinformatics company from the Netherlands](http://thehyve.nl/).
